# OS_Project_Algorithms

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of key algorithms from the Operating System curriculum. Developed as part of a team effort, the project provides a hands-on, interactive approach to learning and understanding essential OS concepts through real-time visualizations.

### üìÇ Included Algorithms:

1. **Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive)**  
   This scheduling algorithm selects the job with the smallest execution time to run next, minimizing the average waiting time.
   
2. **Dining Philosopher's Problem (with Semaphores)**  
   A classic synchronization problem demonstrating the challenges of resource sharing and deadlock prevention in multi-process environments.
   
3. **Look / C-Look Disk Scheduling Algorithm**  
   Disk scheduling algorithms that optimize the movement of the disk‚Äôs head to minimize seek time. The C-Look variant wraps around the disk in a circular fashion for more efficiency.
   
4. **FIFO (First In First Out) Page Replacement Algorithm**  
   A page replacement algorithm used to manage memory by replacing the oldest page in the memory first.

## üîç Features:

In this web-based project, you will experience:
- A clear explanation of each algorithm and its use case in operating systems.
- Interactive input options to see how each algorithm behaves with different data sets.
- Real-time visualizations to enhance your understanding beyond theoretical explanations.
- A learning experience designed to simulate how these algorithms work in actual operating system environments.

## üìä Visualizing the Algorithms

The platform provides enhanced visualization to make it easier to comprehend the concepts behind these algorithms. Users can input different values and see the algorithm's step-by-step execution, making abstract concepts more concrete.
